# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District analysis

Tasked with preparing all standardizrd math and reading test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.  These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level.

After initial analysis was completed, it was noted that all the 9th grade math and reading scores were altered (academic dishonesty) and needed to be removed from the analysis.  These scores were replaced with NaN in the student dataset and the analysis was repeated.

A comparison of the two analyses for key insights is provided below.

Resources - Data Sources : schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv; Software: Python 3.8; Jupyter Notebook 6.1.1; Libraries: pandas, numpy
